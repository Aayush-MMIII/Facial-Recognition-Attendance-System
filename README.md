# Facial Recognition Attendance System

## Overview

This project implements a facial recognition attendance system using computer vision techniques. The system automates the process of taking attendance by capturing images of individuals and recognizing their faces to mark their presence. It offers a convenient and efficient alternative to traditional attendance tracking methods.

## Key Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes face detection algorithms to identify faces in images or video streams.
- **Face Recognition**: Employs deep learning-based facial recognition models to match detected faces with known individuals.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Records attendance by associating recognized faces with registered individuals.
- **User Management**: Allows administrators to manage the database of registered users and their attendance records.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time monitoring of attendance status, allowing administrators to track attendance as it happens.
- **Reporting**: Generates attendance reports for different time periods, helping administrators analyze attendance trends and patterns.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- dlib
- Face recognition libraries (e.g., dlib's facial recognition model, OpenCV's face recognition module)
- SQLite or MySQL for database management

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System.git

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Prepare the dataset: Collect images of individuals for training the facial recognition model. Ensure a diverse set of images capturing different angles, lighting conditions, and facial expressions.

4. Train the model: Use the collected dataset to train the facial recognition model. Fine-tune the model parameters as needed to achieve satisfactory recognition performance.

5. Configure the system: Update configuration files to specify paths to the trained model, dataset, and other parameters.

6. Run the system: Execute the main script to start the facial recognition attendance system. Monitor the system output for attendance updates and reports.

## Usage
Register Users: Add new users to the system by capturing their images and associating them with unique identifiers.
Take Attendance: Run the system to capture images of individuals and recognize their faces to mark attendance.
View Reports: Generate and view attendance reports to track attendance trends over time.
